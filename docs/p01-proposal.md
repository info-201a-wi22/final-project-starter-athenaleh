|Abstract | Our main question for this project is to see the role that mental health plays in our world. Considering that mental health has only recently become acknowledged as a serious problem, we can get a better understanding of how mental health plays into people’s lives. To address this concern, we will observe the prevalence of different mental health issues by looking at the rates of mental health per country/region.|
|Keywords |Mental health issues, Global Health, Countries |
|1.0 Introduction | In this project, this group will be focusing on the prevalence of mental health issues in different countries. The prevalence of mental health issues in specific that we will be looking at are schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, drug use disorders, depressive disorders, and alcohol use disorders. We hope that our research will provide clear insight on steps that countries with poor mental health could implement to improve the quality of life to ultimately reduce mental health issues for the global community. **We believe that mental health is an important topic to normalize and spread information about. In conducting our research, we hope to achieve this.** |
|2.0 Design Situation | **The topic of concern** we are focusing on is mental illnesses across the world, specifically the way that is tied to government actions. We are looking at the layout of mental illnesses and the way governments are or are not exacerbating those issues in terms of social resources for the people in that nation. Key elements include population health, global trends, and social structure in relation to the percentage of mental illnesses. **HUMAN VALUES** The human values connected to our topic of concern are power and awareness. The values originate from compassion as our project aims to find different correlations to improve global mental health. We also based Data Feminism’s definition of power into the human value. Power is an important human value because having the power to be influential can help spread awareness. We are also making sure that we spread awareness of factors that affect mental health and well-being: environmental factors, social and economic circumstances, and individual attributes and behaviors. The **direct stakeholders** are government officials, physicians (i.e. psychiatrists and psychologists) and organizations (i.e. World Health Organization). As direct stakeholders, they have the power to influence and implement change to provide mental health resources for the people. Physicians are able to have a better understanding of how they can be the source of assistance for their patients. Organizations can use this data to provide assistance to government officials. Indirect stakeholders are citizens because they may not know that this data is being collected and used to analyze different mental health issues globally. **HARMS AND BENEFITS** The potential benefits are mental health is improved for the indirect stakeholders and the government can have an idea of ways that they can implement change to improve the well-being of their citizens. The potential harm is that there is a wide difference between cultures so some implementations may not work for different cultures. While we can avoid the potential harm, we might not be able to avoid the unanticipated consequences. If the government has implemented some type of change, the people could react negatively which could cause an increase in mental health issues. Here are 3 citations to related work: ​​|
|3.0 Research questions | We would like to consider and address the following questions because we believe this will shape and push our project forward.  These questions are important because they focus our efforts in the same direction. **1: Which continent/region has the most mental health problems?** _We can answer this question by merging and summarizing each country into their corresponding continent. We would then calculate the average mental health percentage of each continent._  **2: What is the most prevalent mental health problem among the countries? Least prevalent?** _We would take the average of each mental health column. Whichever has the highest average is the most common mental health issue that can be seen all around the world_ **3: How has the prevalence of mental health problems developed over time (1990-2019)?** _We would create a graph for each continent that summarizes it's mental health issues throughout the years._ **4: Which country has the highest amount of mental health issues?** _Which has the lowest? We would answer this question by grouping together the country names and then taking the average of each of the columns as well as taking the average of the average mental health columns. We would then use those averages to conclude which has the highest/lowest mental health rates.__  **Further research:** We intend to find further research on governmental actions and social welfare to address specific correlations on  countries and their population's mental illnesses. |
